## About
The story begins with around 8 friends sitting in a hostel room of
IIT-Jodhpur, trying to find some ideas for a Hackathon (which 
eventually was cancelled) and fighting for whose music to play.
Solution? lets Vote. <br>
This project aims to serve this use-case. <br>
People connected over the same local network can connect to
it and add their favourite music to the server, 
vote (Upvote/Downvote) for the music they like/dislike,
can listen to music from server to there local devices and Paaarrrty! (; <br>
This project also aims to replace small DJs usually in small parties,
with a microcontroller-based local area server running on IPv4 and
connected to large speakers. Giving people in the party democratic
control over music using their mobile phones or any other device 
which could be connected to the private local area network.<br>
